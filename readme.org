* wignerd.jl
Another julia learning project: re-implementation of [[https://github.com/dhanson/quicklens/blob/master/quicklens/math/wignerd.c][wignerd.c]] library in julia.

As of now, =cf_from_cl= is around 2-3 times faster than the version in
wignerd.c, and =cl_from_cf= is around 3 times faster than the version in
wignerd.c.
