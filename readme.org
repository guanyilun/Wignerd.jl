* wignerd.jl
Another julia learning project: re-implementation of [[https://github.com/dhanson/quicklens/blob/master/quicklens/math/wignerd.c][wignerd.c]] library in julia.

As of now, =cf_from_cl= is around 2.5 times faster than the version in
wignerd.c, and =cl_from_cf= is around 4 times faster than the version in
wignerd.c.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
using wignerd

lmax = 3000
npoints = 4501

l = collect(0:lmax)
cl = @. l*(l+1)  # dummy

glq = wignerd.glquad(npoints)

# calculate cf = \sum_l d^l_{22}(\beta) cl(l)
cf = wignerd.cf_from_cl(glq, 2, 2, cl)

# calculate cl = \int_{-1}^1 d\cos\beta cf(\beta) d_{13}^l(\beta)
cl = wignerd.cl_from_cf(glq, 1, 3, lmax, cf)
#+END_SRC
